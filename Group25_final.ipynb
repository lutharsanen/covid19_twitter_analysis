    "The goal of the project is to process a raw dataset from beginning to end, going through each of the steps in the data science pipeline. The ongoing coronavirus crisis has upended not only our semester, but our lives, so our group could not think of a more fitting topic to examine with this project. There are now over 18,000 published papers about the new coronavirus in the database of the USA's National Library of Medicine (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), reflecting 6 months of experience with the coronavirus. However, amidst the rapidly evolving threat, the most up-to-date information was often shared via social media platforms both for front-line ER doctors sharing clinical procedures (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/well/live/coronavirus-doctors-facebook-twitter-social-media-covid.html) and for the broader scientific community and reporters, sharing insights and ideas to combat the crisis, and policy proposals to limit the economic effects of the crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its timeliness and reputation, as well as the company's relative openness to sharing data with developers via their API, made Twitter a logical source of data for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early in the crisis, many people the world over (though most prominently, populists with their \"anti-expert\" bias) claimed the media was overreacting to the crisis, and sensationalizing the threat. While this interpretation has been clearly born out as false, our group is interested in how closely the more organic, bottom-up \"buzz\" around the virus correlates with the actual rates of infection. Much has been made about the virus's exponential spread: do posts about the virus in affected regions follow the same pattern? How can we understand not only the patterns within countries but the differences between countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook includes the code used for exploring, processing, analyzing, and visualizing the data set. The data sets themselves can be downloaded via the GitHub link for the project. While the coronavirus case counts were provided in an already aggregated form and required very limited preprocessing, due to the massive amount of unaggregated Twitter data, the study was limited in time from February 12th through April 10th. \n",
    "\n",
    "Early in the semester we chose to look at Italy for a case study, as indications weren't clear how the pandemic would play out. As the semester progressed, and the pandemic continued its spread, we realized that a comparison of two countries would yield a more fruitful comparison. With a higher number cases and deaths than any country in the world, the USA provides a solid point of comparison with Italy. Due to the large number of cases (and tweets) in the United States, New York state was chosen as our case study. Throughout the pandemic, New York has had the highest number of cases and deaths of any US state, and New York City has seen the worst of it (see Figure 2). "

The following code is meant to show the key parts of the approach taken, additional code can be provided on request.\n",

    "As can be seen in the code, the hashtag strings used to query Twitter were #COVID19, #COVID-19, #covid_19, #covid, #corona, and #coronavirus  (note: Twitter hashtags are not case-sensitive). A search through Twitter to find the main hashtags used when people discussed the pandemic yielded the selection of these tags. If any of these was mentioned in a tweet, that tweet becomes part of our dataset. As the twitter API provides a great deal of metadata, we limited the query to data points of key interest."

    "Figures 5 and 6 show behavior somewhat contradictory to what we were expecting. The tweets showing positive polarity outnumber the negative tweets on each day, and outnumber the neutral tweets in almost all cases. This could be evidencing the limitations of the TextBlob when faced with mixed sentiment (a tweet encouraging people to stay strong and stay home, for example, might yield a positive polarity), or it could truly be a finding: that the majority of people on Twitter made positive statements about coronavirus or their #lockdownLife. Considering that Twitter users tend to be better educated and wealthier than the broader public, we could also simply be seeing self-selection bias at work (Pew Research: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/04/24/sizing-up-twitter-users/). With the benefit of hindsight, we can consider that the total number of new cases did not peak until April 14th, which makes the increasing spread between positive and negative tweets shown in Figure 6 a bit of an empirical puzzle. \n",

    "Further research work on the connection between social media activity and the coronavirus would be needed in order to draw firmer conclusions. The empirical setup we have established with this study serves as an exploratory analysis and framework for further work on this topic."
